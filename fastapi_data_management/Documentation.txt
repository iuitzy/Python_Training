In this Handon practice the steps i followed to set up are as follows 
1.Tried setting up the project setup in a modular way so the code would be in different folders easy to access and modify 
2. created routes folder and in that separate route mechanism for user and products (used javascript for incrementing and decrementing the products)
3. crud file for database operations and persistance 
4. simple static styles 
5. templates folder for a simple index.html 
6.data.csv stores the data for the products 
7.database.py for creating the db if the folder structure 

I tried creating simple api for fetching all the data and posting it back to db and bare minimum css 

and replicate the same end points given in the document
